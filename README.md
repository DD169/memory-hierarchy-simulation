# Memory Hierarchy Simulator

This project simulates the paths that memory accesses take through a computer's memory hierarchy.

Edit configuration settings in ./trace.config

Edit the requests in file 'requestList_USE_THIS.dat'


## Getting Started

You'll need something to build and run this project.

[Reason Why Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)

I recommend installing [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or perhaps try Vite's [online mode](https://vite.new/).

```bash
# Install dependencies, including vite & svelte
$ npm install

# Build and Run
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

## Developer Mode

```bash
# Install dependencies, including vite & svelte
$ npm install

# Start in watch mode
$ npm run dev
```

## What happens now?

I intend to continue working on this. I think that merging this project with the Instruction Set project would be pretty neat.
